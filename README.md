MSR
===
Microstate sparse reconstruction (MSR) is an optimization algorithm that solves the inverse problem: recovering an all-atom state consistent with a coarse-grained description.

WORKING EXAMPLE
===============
python MSRWriter.py struct traj tpr tol

-struct: structure file such as a pdb or gro file

-traj: trajectory file such as a trr, xtc, or dcd

-tpr: binary input file generated by Gromacs (with grompp) for reading topology

-tol: tolerance set for the atomic displacement, below convergence is assumed to be achieved
